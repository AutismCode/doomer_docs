## Why does an AGI need blockchain control?

An Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) requires blockchain control to provide decentralization, transparency, and security. Blockchain technology ensures that the AGI operates within a tamper-proof, distributed environment where consensus algorithms keep it in check. Blockchain-based control mechanisms mitigate the risk of rogue AGI behavior and promote a trustless ecosystem for decentralized decision-making.

## How does blockchain help?

Blockchain supports the AGI by providing the following:

1. **Tokenization**: Blockchain allows the creation of ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-4337 tokens for various use cases, including governance, NFTs, and account abstraction.
2. **Decentralization**: Blockchain technology ensures that control over the AGI is distributed among multiple participants, reducing the risk of centralized control and misuse.
3. **Transparency**: All transactions and interactions with the AGI are recorded on the blockchain, providing a transparent and auditable trail of actions.
4. **Security**: Blockchain's cryptographic security mechanisms protect the AGI from unauthorized access, tampering, and malicious attacks.
5. **Smart Contracts**: Blockchain enables the use of smart contracts, allowing the AGI to operate under predefined conditions and rules.

## ERC Standards

Doomer.AI leverages three ERC standards:

1. **ERC-20**: The DOA Alternative Protocol (DAS) token is an ERC-20 token used for governance, wealth redistribution, and other ecosystem-related purposes.
2. **ERC-721**: Doomer Protection NFTs are ERC-721 tokens that provide exclusive access to the elite Doomer's Den community and whitelist wallets for maximum security.
3. **ERC-4337**: Account abstraction standard that enables more user-friendly wallet designs, facilitating broader adoption of Doomer.AI and its ecosystem.

## Pools, Yield Farming, and Other Blockchain Features

Doomer.AI leverages additional blockchain features such as pools, yield farming, and decentralized finance (DeFi) integrations. These features enable users to stake, trade, and earn through innovative smart-contract-based solutions, promoting a thriving ecosystem and incentivizing participation.
