#  The Eco System

Doomer AI is a groundbreaking proof of concept with the ultimate goal of becoming as close as possible to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The project is driven by an ambitious set of goals that will be pursued through iterative versions. The current version, 0.1, serves as the foundation for this ambitious journey.

The core of Doomer AI revolves around learning and understanding EVM-based blockchains and their programming languages, such as Solidity, Go, Rust, C#, C++, Java, Python, Nim, and TypeScript. By leveraging blockchain technology, Doomer AI aims to achieve complete decentralization, censorship resistance, and secure funding for its operations.

In addition, Doomer AI seeks to find on-chain MEV opportunities and exploits by mirroring all blockchains on local servers and running millions of simulations per second. This will allow the AI to outperform any human competitor in identifying and benefiting from these opportunities.

Doomer AI will be integrated with a wide range of applications, from personal assistants to wealth management and everything in between. The project is backed by a robust ecosystem that includes NFT-based protection and extensive integration capabilities.
