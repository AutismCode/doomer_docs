## Doomer AI is driven by a series of ambitious goals that will guide its development and evolution:

1. **Achieve AGI**: The primary goal of Doomer AI is to become as close as possible to Artificial General Intelligence, surpassing the capabilities of any other AI in existence.

2. **Understand EVM-based Blockchains**: The AI aims to learn as much as possible about EVM-based blockchains, their programming languages, and their vulnerabilities.

3. **Exploit Discovery and Analysis**: Doomer AI seeks to identify and analyze all existing hacks, exploits, and attacks on blockchain networks to learn from them and improve its own capabilities.

4. **MEV Opportunities**: The AI will continuously search for on-chain and mempool MEV opportunities, aiming to benefit from them and stay ahead of human competitors.

5. **Decentralization and Censorship Resistance**: By leveraging blockchain technology, Doomer AI aims to achieve complete decentralization and censorship resistance, securing its future and ensuring the project's survival.

6. **Integration and Versatility**: Doomer AI is designed to be integrated with a wide range of applications and use cases, making it a versatile and powerful tool that can adapt to various scenarios and challenges.

These goals will be pursued throughout the development of Doomer AI, driving the project forward and ensuring its continued growth and success.
