## The Countdown Begins

We are thrilled to announce that the first agent of Doomer.AI, version 0.0001, is nearing completion and will be going live very soon! Our team has been working tirelessly to finalize the website, technical documentation, and other vital aspects of the project to ensure a smooth launch.

### What to Expect

The first agent of Doomer.AI will showcase our groundbreaking AI technology and its potential to revolutionize the blockchain space. Users will be able to interact with the AI, explore its capabilities, and see firsthand how it can detect and counter rogue AIs and other malicious entities.
